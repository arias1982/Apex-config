# Apex-config   

In the top my sensitivity and some other binds are bound. You might want to change that.   

videoconfig.txt location   
`C:\Users\\[usr name]\Saved Games\Respawn\Apex\local`   

autoexec.cfg location   
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Apex\cfg`   
    
Due to some bug game wont start with commands in launch options any more. So we need to load it in another way.   
in `C:\Users\\[usr name]\Saved Games\Respawn\Apex\local\settings.cfg` add `exec userconfig.cfg` and make it read only
